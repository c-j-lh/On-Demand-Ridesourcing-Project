# Trip-Vehicle Assignment Algorithm (REASSIGN)
The code contained in this repository represents a Python implementation of REASSIGN Algorithm depicted in:

## What is REASSIGN?
REASSIGN is a *graph-based reassignment algorithm* that balances two objectives in ridesourcing platform decision making: system efficiency and driver fairness. It allows flexible shifting between decisions with trade-off guarantees.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders and subfolders, which has been named according to the scripts directory that we used in the codes. A few things to note:

- Main scripts for our experiments can be found in [Simulation Codes](./SimulationCodes). 
- In [Data](./Data) subfolders, several files have been omitted due to upload size limit. These files can be downloaded through this [external link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Zs3Qi6V4K0WiK4zYP-S1QMTJCBh1xk30). 
- [Results](./Results) do not contain our actual simulation results. These files are created as samples.
