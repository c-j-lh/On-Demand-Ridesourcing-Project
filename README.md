# Trip-Vehicle Assignment Algorithm (REASSIGN)
The code contained in this repository represents an implementation of REASSIGN Algorithm depicted in:

Balancing Efficiency and Fairness in On-Demand Ridesourcing (in Proc. NeurIPS 2019),<br/>
*Nixie S. Lesmana, Xuan Zhang, Xiaohui Bei*

## What is REASSIGN?
REASSIGN is a *graph-based reassignment algorithm* that balances system efficiency and driver fairness in ridesourcing platform decision making. It allows flexible shifting between decisions with theoretical guarantees on the trade-off.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders and subfolders, which has been named according to the scripts directory that we used in the codes. A few things to note of:

- Main scripts for our experiments can be found in [Simulation Codes](./SimulationCodes). 
- In [Data](./Data) subfolders, several files have been omitted due to upload size limit. These files can be downloaded through external link (refer to [Data Preprocessing, Simulation Setup, and Code Summary](./SI.pdf)). 
- [Results](./Results) do not contain our actual simulation results. These files are created as samples.
